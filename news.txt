As a small nation with temporary membership of the UNâ€™s 15-nation inner sanctum, Ireland has contributed to council debates as the crisis has escalated, supporting Ukraineâ€™s sovereignty and territory integrity and calling Russiaâ€™s actions a â€œflagrant violation of international lawâ€. Irelandâ€™s ambassador to the UN, Geraldine Byrne Nason, spoke at an emergency session on Monday night which was called after Russian leader Vladimir Putin recognised Donetsk and Luhansk in Ukraine as independent entities and ordered Russian troops into the two regions. Irelandâ€™s ambassador to the UN, Geraldine Byrne Nason Even the calling of the meeting at short notice was in line with the Governmentâ€™s view that the council must remain relevant, engaged and open to meet as crises dictates. The fact that Russia holds the councilâ€™s rotating presidency makes statements at these meetings even more important. Russian veto Russiaâ€™s veto power as one of the five permanent members of the council - with ally China as another â€˜P5â€™ member - limits resolutions being passed against the Kremlin or any unanimous declaration of condemnation against Putin, but the council is seen as playing an important role in the public-relations war. â€œThe view within the Biden administration is that this is a global crisis and the UN Security Council is an appropriate forum and has an important role to play,â€ said Tom Wright, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, the US-based foreign policy think tank. â€œEven if it is not going to be possible to get action, this is where the case can be made in the court of global public opinion.â€ The council can be used as a forum to sway countries that might have good relations with Russian or to raise concern about the humanitarian consequences of Russiaâ€™s actions. â€œIt is not just about condemnation but trying to mobilise like-minded countries to mitigate some of the worst consequences of the invasion,â€ said Wright. The powerful speech delivered by Kenyaâ€™s ambassador to the UN Martin Kimani at Mondayâ€™s emergency session, which generated headlines around the world, shows the capacity of small nations to be the pebble in the shoe of large nations. â€œThis situation echoes our history,â€ Kimani said. â€œKenya and almost every African country was birthed by the end of an empire. Our borders are not of our own drawings. They were drawn in the distant colonial metropoles of London, Paris and Lisbon with no regard for the ancient nations that they cleaved apart.â€ The Kenyan statement showed how even small countries could use the highest level of a countryâ€™s representation globally to put a strong statement on the historical record. Global perspective â€œIt wasnâ€™t just a condemnation but it was setting it in the context of colonialism and giving the global perspective of what this represented,â€ said Wright. Nason has also evoked Irelandâ€™s own past in voicing support for Ukraine, telling the council last week that its sovereign right to defend itself was â€œa right that Ireland struggled to obtainâ€. As one of only two EU states on the council, there will be a lot of pressure on Irish officials to reflect the EU position on Ukraine. â€œWe will stick quite close to France, â€ said one diplomat. Another international forum the Government will have an eye on is the Council of Europe, where Ireland takes over as chair in May. Russia is a member of the 47-nation council and Irish diplomats could find themselves in another central role when Russiaâ€™s suspension from the council could be considered, should the situation deteriorate further in Ukraine. â€œIf you put yourself forward for positions, you have to be prepared to take on the difficult stuff,â€ said one Irish official.#03/05/2022#0#0#POLITICS#0#0#12#Alaska Prepares For 'Historic-Level' Storm Barreling Towards Coast#â€œIn 10 years, people will be referring to the September 2022 storm as a benchmark storm.â€#17/09/2022#0#0#ENTERTAINMENT#0#0#67#â€˜Fox & Friendsâ€™ Host Questions Why Trump Kept Classified Documents At Mar-A-Lago#"These are the biggest secrets in the world," Steve Doocy said in response to the ex-president keeping top secret documents at his private residence.#31/08/2022#0#0#POLITICS#0#0#124#"Ukraine wants its foreign debt written off"#Head of Ukraineâ€™s Accounts Chamber urged international financial organizations to scrap the countryâ€™s debts amid alleged destruction Read Full Article at RT.com#03/03/2022#0#0#POLITICS#0#0#19#Meet Alex Aster, The TikToker Changing The Publishing Industry For The Better#The Colombian-American author's new book "Lightlark" was rejected numerous times â€” until she went directly to her readers for support.#15/09/2022#9#2#CULTURE & ARTS#0#2#douaa #sdsad#douaa #adsadsa#a#5#douaa #4#138#"Ukraine separatists ask for Russiaâ€™s help as Kyiv drafts men"#There is still no clear indication of whether Russian President Vladimir Putin will launch a massed assault on Ukraine with the tens of thousands of troops he has gathered on its borders#03/05/2022#0#0#POLITICS#0#0#8#Las Vegas Aces Win First WNBA Title, Chelsea Gray Named MVP#Las Vegas never had a professional sports champion â€” until Sunday. #19/09/2022#0#0#SPORT#0#0#109#Vanessa Bryant Says Kobe Bryant Crash Photos Turned Grief To Horror#Bryant's widow testified that she "lives in fear every day" that the photos of her husband's death will pop up on social media.#19/08/2022#0#0#SPORT#0#0#64#Rep.

Luke Ellis, whose firm has $148.6bn in assets and reported record client inflows and a 230 per cent rise in profits for last year, said on Tuesday he was â€œscepticalâ€ of whether markets had really seen the end of â€œeasy moneyâ€, despite strong central bank rhetoric in recent months that interest rates would have to rise to combat inflation. â€œThe Ukraine situation pushes that out,â€ Ellis told the Financial Times. â€œItâ€™s likely that central banks will be less aggressive than they would have been, even though their problem is worse. â€œThis [war in Ukraine] is clearly inflationary,â€ he added. Majority His comments come after central banks have targeted tighter monetary policy to try and control a surge in inflation, which hit a higher than forecast rate of 7.5 per cent in the US in January - a 40-year high. A recent poll of 45 economists by the FT and the Initiative on Global Markets at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business found that a majority expected the federal funds rate to increase from its current near-zero level to a minimum of 1.5 per cent by the end of this year. Ellis also said that Man Groupâ€™s funds had sold out of virtually all of their positions in Russia and Ukraine before Christmas, on fears that rising tensions would lead to capital controls. He said the firm still had what he described as a â€œde minimisâ€ position in Russian equities, which it had not managed to sell but which â€œmakes no differenceâ€. Man on Tuesday reported record net inflows during the year of $13.7 billion (â‚¬12.2 billion), with $7.2 billion of these coming in the fourth quarter alone. Last yearâ€™s flows equal almost the entirety of the $13.9 billion net inflows recorded by the whole of the $3.6tn hedge fund industry for 2021, as measured by data group eVestment. Statutory pre-tax profit jumped from $179mn in 2020 to $590mn last year, helped by a near-quadrupling of performance fee earnings and a rise in management fees. Gains While hedge funds made gains during the pandemic on average, helped by rising markets, it has often been the biggest firms who have prospered most. Manâ€™s rivals Citadel and Millennium, for instance, have posted large gains, helped by their diversification across assets, an ability to raise or cut risk quickly and their ability to hire traders. Man posted strong gains in a number of its funds last year, aided by rising markets and a move by investors into cheaper, so-called value stocks. Its $4.7 billion AHL Evolution fund, which bets on trends in almost 800 niche markets, rose 17 per cent, while its GLG Japan CoreAlpha fund gained 28.2 per cent. Its AHL TargetRisk strategy, which aims to balance risk across equities, government bonds, credit and inflation-linked bonds, gained 14.4 per cent and grew from $11.2 billion to $18.7 billion in assets during the year. Ellis said that after two consecutive quarters of record net inflows at the end of last year, the firm was â€œback to normal nowâ€ but added that clients had not â€œhit the panic buttonâ€ in response to a choppy start to 2022 in markets. Man Groupâ€™s share price was up 1 per cent to 195.05p at around midday on Tuesday. â€“ Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2022#03/05/2022#0#0#POLITICS#0#0#21#Kim Kardashian's Next Boyfriend Could Be A Biochemist#The reality star told James Corden she's branching out because "clearly it's not working, whatever Iâ€™m doing."#15/09/2022#0#0#ENTERTAINMENT#0#0#50#Muslims Only Make Up 1% Of Characters On TV, Study Finds#In most of the 200 scripted shows that researchers analyzed, Muslim characters were typically violent, dehumanized or disparaged â€” if they existed at all.#07/09/2022#0#0#ENTERTAINMENT#0#0#127#"Ukraine crisis: Sick children treated in hospital basement to escape shelling"#Many Kyiv residents have moved underground to escape Russiaâ€™s bombardment of their city.Seriously ill youngsters at Okhmatdyt Childrenâ€™s Hospital are no exception, often down in the buildingâ€™s basement amid the ongoing assault on Ukraine.The hospital is the largest of its kind in the country and typically handles up to 600 patients, said its chief surgeon Volodymyr Zhovnir on Monday.However, amid Russiaâ€™s invasion, the patient count has dropped to around 200, said Zhovnir.â€œThese are patientsâ€¦#03/03/2022#0#0#POLITICS#0#0#37#Biden Honors 9/11 Victims, Vows Commitment To Thwart Terror#President Joe Biden has marked the 21st anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks, taking part in a somber wreath-laying ceremony held at the Pentagon under a steady rain.#11/09/2022#0#0#POLITICS#0#0#46#Norman Reedus Opens Up About 'Walking Dead' Injury: 'I Thought I Was Going To Die'#The actor said he was so badly concussed while shooting the series finale that he feared for his life and was "holding onto the walls" while recovering.#08/09/2022#0#0#ENTERTAINMENT#0#0#71#The Vow Part Two' Trailer Dives Deeper Into Downfall Of Twisted NXIVM Cult#HBO will release a six-part follow up to the series beginning in October about the infamous sex cult led by Keith Raniere.#30/08/2022#0#0#ENTERTAINMENT#0#0#62#Toxic Algae Causes Thousands Of Dead Fish To Wash Ashore In California#The unprecedented red tide is creating a foul odor that may get worse during the oncoming heat wave.#01/09/2022#0#0#ENTERTAINMENT#0#0#48#Portland Residents With Disabilities Sue Over City's Blocked Sidewalks#The lawsuit says allowing homeless peopleâ€™s tents to block city sidewalks makes it difficult for people using wheelchairs, walkers or canes to use them.#08/09/2022#0#0#POLITICS#0#0#129#"Russia pummels Ukraine's No. 2 city and convoy nears Kyiv"#Russian strikes pounded the central square in Ukraineâ€™s second-largest city and other civilian targets, and a 40-mile convoy of tanks and other vehicles threatened the capital.
